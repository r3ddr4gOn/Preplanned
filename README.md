This is my version of the Mod "Preplanned" by ThatGuyFromBreakingBad. The original can be found at https://github.com/thatguyfrombb/Preplanned/

I tweaked the mod to my personal preferrence.
- There are now 3 save slots
- You can clear the preplanning (except votes)
- You can save/load assets (when there is no preplanning menu)
- Saving also saves the chosen elements of other players

Keys:
F4: Clear everything (host only)
F5: Clear own elements
F6: Save to Slot 1
F7: Save to Slot 2
F8: Save to Slot 3
F9: Load from Slot 1
F10: Load from Slot 2
F11: Load from Slot 3
