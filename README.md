This is my version of the Mod "Preplanned" by ThatGuyFromBreakingBad. The original can be found at https://github.com/thatguyfrombb/Preplanned/

This branch holds the BLT friendly Version

I tweaked the mod to my personal preferrence:
- There are now 3 save slots
- You can clear the preplanning (except votes)
- You can save/load assets (when there is no preplanning menu)
- Saving also saves the chosen elements of other players

Keybinds:
- Clear everything (host only)
- Clear own elements
- Save to Slot 1
- Save to Slot 2
- Save to Slot 3
- Load from Slot 1
- Load from Slot 2
- Load from Slot 3
